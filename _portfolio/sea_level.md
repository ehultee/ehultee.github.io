As the climate warms, glaciers and ice sheets shed mass to the ocean, and sea levels rise.  That shedding of ice mass can happen through melting,
breaking off of icebergs, or changes in glacier flow.  The latter two comprise "dynamic mass loss" and have been a major source of uncertainty
in projections of 21st-century sea level change.

I have written a model called SERMeQ - the Simple Estimator of Retreat Magnitude and ice flux (Q) - to produce an upper-bound estimate on calving glaciers' contribution to 21st-century sea level rise.  The model is applicable to any marine-terminating glacier whose front is not floating.  One important application is to study changes on each of the 200 outlet glaciers draining the Greenland Ice Sheet.

## Example
Below is an animation of a SERMeQ-simulated retreat on Columbia Glacier, Alaska.  We see a profile of the glacier (grey) along
a centerline. The grey glacier ice flows from figure left to right over bedrock (brown) down to the sea (blue).  Observed glacier profiles appear
in purple for comparison.
