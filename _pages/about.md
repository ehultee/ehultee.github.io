I am a glaciologist, which can mean: climate scientist, physicist, applied mathematician, and more.  My work in this inherently interdisciplinary field focuses on describing how glaciers and ice sheets lose mass through ice fracture.

Alongside my scientific interests, I have long been involved in volunteering and NGO administration related to intercultural education & exchange.  Outside of work, I enjoy photography, spending time outdoors, and playing in symphony orchestras.
