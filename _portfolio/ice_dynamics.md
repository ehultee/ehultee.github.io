Ice loss from the polar ice sheets is the largest anticipated contribution to 21st century global mean sea level rise.
A fundamental control on the rate of ice loss is how fast ice flows from ice sheet interiors out to the edges.
In the interior of the Greenland Ice Sheet, ice flow responds
to liquid water ("runoff") input, which affects how the ice slides over the bedrock beneath. At
ocean-terminating "outlet glaciers" around the edges of Greenland, ice 
flows into the ocean with
speed that varies by season. That strong seasonal variation makes it more difficult to tell to what
extent liquid water input is affecting the 
flow speed. Identifying the relative strength of ocean-driven versus melt-driven ice 
flow variations is essential for the computer models used to forecast
future ice loss. It has been difficult to assess those factors in a consistent way because they operate
over multiple time scales, thus requiring different methods of observation that could not be directly
compared.

I have used flexible time series analysis methods to show that a large glacier in East Greenland 
responds to ocean and atmospheric forcing at different time scales.  I am now lead PI on a 
National Science Foundation grant that will collect new field observations in West Greenland, 
analyze them in a multivariate statistical framework with satellite observations, and extend
our analyses to other settings with idealized numerical modeling in Elmer/Ice.

## Extensions
Findings about the material properties of ice can inform process modelling and broader-scale model parameterizations of iceberg calving.
Further, the study of ice deformation and fracture has appealing similarities to the study of rock deformation and fracture.
New collaborations applying insight from rock mechanics to ice, or vice versa, would be very interesting.
