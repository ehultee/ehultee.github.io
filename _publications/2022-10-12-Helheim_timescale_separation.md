The Greenland Ice Sheet discharges ice to the ocean through hundreds of outlet glaciers. 
Recent acceleration of Greenland outlet glaciers has been linked to both oceanic and 
atmospheric drivers. Here, we leverage temporally dense observations, regional climate 
model output, and newly developed time series analysis tools to assess the most important 
forcings causing ice ﬂow variability at one of the largest Greenland outlet glaciers, 
Helheim Glacier, from 2009 to 2017. We ﬁnd that ice speed correlates most strongly with 
catchment-integrated runoff at seasonal to interannual scales, while multiannual ﬂow 
variability correlates most strongly with multi-annual terminus variability. The disparate 
time scales and the inﬂuence of subglacial topography on Helheim Glacier’s dynamics 
highlight different regimes that can inform modeling and forecasting of its future. 
Notably, our results suggest that the recent terminus history observed at Helheim is a 
response to, rather than the cause of, upstream changes.
