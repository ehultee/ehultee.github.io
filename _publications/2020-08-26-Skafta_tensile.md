We need to understand when ice is likely to break to ensure accuracy in the computer models
we use to predict future ice loss.  Estimates of the strength of ice under tension (pulling apart)
are different at different scales.  Here, we study the sudden draining of an "ice cauldron"
to examine crevasses forming at natural scale on a glacier.
