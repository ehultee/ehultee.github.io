I am a glaciologist, which can mean: climate scientist, physicist, applied mathematician, 
and more.  My work in this inherently interdisciplinary field focuses on describing the processes
and downstream (societal) impacts of glacier and ice sheet change.  Check out what I'm working 
on now at the "Current projects" tab above.

At present, I am an Assistant Professor of Earth & Climate Sciences at Middlebury College, Vermont.
Middlebury students interested in working with me are encouraged to get in touch by email.

Alongside my scientific career, I have long been involved in volunteering and nonprofit administration 
related to intercultural education & exchange.  Outside of work, I enjoy photography, 
spending time outdoors, and playing in symphony orchestras.
