Weeklong intensive workshop (in Spanish) on the topic of glacial water resources.  Students explored glacier physics through lab experiments, reading scholarly articles, proposing field campaigns, and simulating glaciers with the Open Global Glacier Model.

Course outline
======
The course schedule is available as a Google spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sb9-CLB8l8yosVDphq--9vuZa_pch4QhlJx3wqx3qJ4/edit?usp=sharing).  The first page, "Horario diario", is the schedule of sessions for the week.  The second page, "Bloques", describes each session in more detail.

Total time and possible adaptations
======
36 hours of workshop time, including a 2-hr hands-on lab and about 16 hours of computational lab time.

The course is easily modifiable to offer as a semester-long introduction to glaciology course.  The Clubes de Ciencia format, in which workshop participants varied widely in background, have demonstrated this course's utility as a science elective accessible across disciplines.  
Depending on student/department interest, the course could add more technical material in glacier mechanics, hydrology, environmental engineering, science policy, or scientific programming.
