Sea-level change affects coastal communities worldwide.  As glaciers and ice sheets lose 
their ice, the water they once stored can be transferred to the ocean and affect global 
sea level.  We use computer simulators to understand how fast that transfer of ice to the 
ocean can happen. However, current simulations give different estimates of solid ice export 
(“iceberg calving”) from the ice sheets.  It is especially challenging to simulate iceberg 
calving from the hundreds of glaciers that drain ice from the Greenland Ice Sheet to the ocean, 
because those glaciers are smaller than most large-scale computer simulators can distinguish. 
We have developed a new simulator to estimate a fastest-possible rate of ice loss to iceberg 
calving.  Here, we apply it to 155 glaciers draining the Greenland Ice Sheet.  This allows 
us to test our method on five times as many glaciers as was previously possible.  We show 
that our simulator does provide an upper limit on observed rates of glacier change, and 
that the simulated patterns of change over time are representative of observed patterns. 
Our method can be applied to estimate the maximum physically plausible contribution to global 
sea level change from the Greenland Ice Sheet, under a range of future climate scenarios.
