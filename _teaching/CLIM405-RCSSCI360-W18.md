I was instructor of record for this upper-level seminar on multidisciplinary climate literacy, using Community-Based Learning pedagogy. I conceived of the course, created a syllabus, identified community partner organizations, pitched the course to the curriculum committee of U-M's Residential College, and taught it for the first semester it was offered.

Syllabus

Additional materials
======
- Students described their experiences and key learnings on a podcast episode, archived [here](https://hotinhere.us/podcast/knowing-climate-change-a-student-panel-on-accountability-and-accessibility/)
- A collaboratively-written [blog post](https://envirodatagov.org/web-monitoring-in-the-classroom-builds-information-literacy-civic-engagement/) presents perspectives on the course from instructor, community partner organization, and students

Total time and possible adaptations
======
Class met for 14 weeks with two 80-minute seminars per week.  Students also worked remotely with an environmental nonprofit for up to 4 hr/wk.

The course could be modified to offer as an introductory graduate-level seminar in departments of Earth Science, Climate Science, Environmental Studies, or Science & Technology Studies.
