I am a glaciologist, which can mean: climate scientist, physicist, applied mathematician, 
and more.  My work in this inherently interdisciplinary field focuses on describing the processes
and downstream (societal) impacts of glacier and ice sheet change.  Check out what I'm working 
on now at the "Current projects" tab above.

As of September 2024, I am an Associate Research Scientist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center
and Morgan State University, Maryland.  This position affords me much expanded research capacity;
I would be delighted to brainstorm with new collaborators!  Prospective student interns
(undergraduate/graduate) and postdoctoral scholars are also encouraged to get in touch.

Prior to my current appointment, I was an assistant professor of Earth & Climate Sciences
at Middlebury College, Vermont.  I continue to live in Vermont and am happy to connect with
local climate initiatives where relevant.

Alongside my scientific career, I have long been involved in volunteering and nonprofit administration 
related to intercultural education & exchange.  Outside of work, I enjoy photography, 
spending time outdoors, and playing in symphony orchestras.
