Studies of future drought risk use output from global climate models to analyse changing water availability.  We know
that glaciers provide a seasonally important source of fresh water in arid mountain environments, but their effect is often not well
captured in global climate models.  What's more, some areas that currently benefit from abundant glacial water supply may see a decline in
water availability as their basin's glaciers shrink.  How can we account for changing glacial effects in our estimates of future drought risk?

In this collaborative effort, we have devised a method to consistently combine output from global climate models with output from a
global glacier runoff model.  We analyse the statistics of our data in many dimensions: across climate scenarios, hydrological basins, and climate models.
Our preliminary results indicate that glaciers are an important modulator of drought risk in some basins but not in others, and that their effect is likely to
persist even after this century of climate change.
