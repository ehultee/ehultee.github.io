Glacier and ice sheet research is frequently justified on the basis of potential benefits 
to those communities that are most vulnerable to glacier change. In this glaciology 
research, funding priorities and communication to the broader public are strongly affected 
by the experiences and values of glaciology researchers. Using population data and newly 
available survey data from research organizations including glaciologists, we show that 
there is a substantial misalignment between the demographics of those who stand to benefit 
from glaciological research and those who produce glaciological knowledge. We discuss the 
potential negative consequences of this misalignment, which causes scientific research to 
be less effective, valuable and usable for communities. We conclude by outlining twenty 
evidence-based strategies that individuals and organizations can adopt to improve the 
recruitment and retention of a more representative group of scientists in glaciological 
research and encourage co-production with communities.
